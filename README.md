## Need Improvements
1. **i18n Localtion Translations**<br/>
We need to improve the localization translations stored in `src/locale`. If you would like to contribute to your own language or fix grammar and typos, please feel free to open a pull request (PR). However, please remember that the JSON data structure must remain the same for other languages, including keys and values.
